### Hi there 👋

I believe it is never too late to start coding.

Steven from University of Milan.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on DSE master program in UNIMI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning statistical learning, machine learning, and beyond
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on small projects in case I get a match
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with faster SL, ML, LLM learning
- 💬 Ask me about my journey at this moment, then coding in the future
- 📫 How to reach me: https://twitter.com/Catchingtides
- 😄 Pronouns: I really do not know what this means
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to learn CS 18 years ago, counted as in 2024, and I regret it a lot

This repository is for:

Storing machine learning course experimental project report and codes
Storing statistical learning course experimental project report and codes
Free code experimentation regarding coding foundation and datascience
Other objectives to be added
